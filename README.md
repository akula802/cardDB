# cardDB
A command-line CRUD app that uses PostgreSQL and Python 3.

Originally designed around a baseball card collection, it can be easily modified for other applications.
Utilizes the datetime, os, psycopg2, re, and texttable libraries. Intended for use in a shell larger than
the standard Windows command prompt - Powershell works great. Resize the shell window if each returned table 
row does not fit on its own line.
